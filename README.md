# Digaminer
A Goldiga CPU miner (rx/0) with Estimated hashrate cap

### ⚠️ Antivirus / False Positive Notice

Some antivirus programs may flag this miner as a **trojan**, **malware**, or **riskware**. This is a **false positive** and is common with mining software due to:

- Low-level CPU access (e.g. MSR instructions)
- Use of hashing algorithms (like RandomX)
- The fact that some malware bundles miners without user consent

This project does **not** contain any malicious code.

If you're unsure or concerned:

- Use something else

> 🧠 **Reminder:** Always download and build from trusted sources. Mining software is frequently abused by bad actors — be safe and verify.
