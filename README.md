# Digaminer ‚Äì Hashrate limited RandomX Miner
**Digaminer** is a lightweight, configurable CPU miner designed for coins using the **RandomX** algorithm ‚Äì primarily optimized for the [Goldiga (GDG)](http://www.goldi.ga) coin.

Goldiga has a built-in maximum hashrate limit per device, enforced by the protocol.  
The cap is set at **950 H/s**.

This application automatically adjusts its performance to stay **just below the 950 H/s threshold**, ensuring compliance while maximizing mining efficiency.

## Antivirus / False Positive Notice

Some antivirus software may flag this miner as **trojan/malware/riskware**.  
This is a **false positive** and common with mining tools due to:

- Use of low-level CPU operations (e.g., MSR register access)
- High-performance hashing routines
- Association with mining software bundled in malware

**This miner does not contain malicious code.**  
Feel free to inspect the `.pdb` (debug symbols) included in the release.

##  Features

- Fast RandomX hashing
- Adjustable thread count and hashrate limit
- Real-time hashrate monitoring (10s / 60s / 5m)
- Optional MSR register tweaks for Intel/AMD CPUs
- Configurable via CLI or config file
- Minimal dependencies

## What is RandomX?

**RandomX** is a CPU-optimized proof-of-work hashing algorithm used primarily by [Monero (XMR)](https://www.getmonero.org). It is designed to:

- Be **memory hard**, to reduce GPU/ASIC advantage
- Use **random code execution and math-heavy operations**
- Favor **general-purpose CPUs** over specialized hardware

## What is Goldiga (GDG)?

[Goldiga](https://www.goldi.ga) is an inclusive, CPU-mining-friendly cryptocurrency built on a **RandomX-based Proof of Work** consensus. It is designed to be accessible, fair, and community-driven ‚Äì inspired by the privacy of Monero and the decentralization of Bitcoin, with a touch of meme culture.

### Key Goals

- **Fair mining**: Maximum hashrate per miner enforced to prevent centralization
- **Device-friendly**: Optimized for mobile phones, low-power CPUs and hobbyist hardware
- **DAO governance**: Every GDG coin equals one vote on network decisions
- **Privacy-first**: Monero-style RingCT keeps transactions secure and private

### Technology Highlights

- **Algorithm**: RandomX (`rx/0`), CPU-only
- **Block time**: 2 minutes
- **Initial reward**: 40 GDG per block
- **Total supply**: 21 million GDG
- **Halving**: Every 210,000 blocks
- **Tail emission**: 0.1 GDG/block (once supply cap is reached)

### Use Cases

- Secure, private digital payments
- Community governance via DAO (1 GDG = 1 vote)
- Fair and inclusive mining for everyone
